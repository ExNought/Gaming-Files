Hey there,

I am a german gamer with a love of collecting games, I also like gaining achivements, ranks (if it comes to a game that has some ...) and items, all with the goal to have fun! 

If a game makes no fun or needs me to go enrage about myself, others or the mechanics, it is not worth my time.

As of today, a nice day in February 2016, I change my goals for Steam and my life:

Here are my new goals:
